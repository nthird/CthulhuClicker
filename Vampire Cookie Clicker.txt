A cookie clicker type game with vampires
starts out simple, harvest blood, sell it buy upgrades
You get more upgrades you can unlock new buildings
Library - research other upgrades
Travel Agency - explore the world to find other beasts and items
Sacrificial Altar - scarifice to gain powers
Eventually you fight like werewolves, zombies etc
You can unlock new skills to get by killing enough
Hire werewolf hunters to take some out for you
You get experience for making kills you can level up a talent tree
Multiple training options

I want skill trees for vampires
3 categories
then when you "beat" the game you can start over keeping a skill
but you can be a werewolf, zombie, witch, ghost, etc
each of which will have its own skill tree
probably start just werewolf and zombie
so make sure the skill trees are interesting for other classes
and figure out a way to make the options makes sense from each class

generally speaking I want multiple categories
I want stuff you can spend blood on, money on, knowledge
I want converting into vampires, powering up yourself, buildings, 
upgrades, research, combat, skill tree

Convert Consume Consider Construct Conflict 
don't have a good one for upgrades or skill tree
generally speaking I want converting to cost blood
powering up to cost blood
buildings to cost money
research to cost knowledge
combat to cost some combination
upgrades to cost any combination
skill tree to come from achievements probably

so I think I want the first thing to be convert
then powering up
power up enough to get bigger guys
until you convert a money guy
then keep going and you get a professor
all of them give blood, some give extra
when you hit enough total blood the stronger thing unlocks

lets make it a sacrifice of minions
shows things are different almost right off the bat
and I think I want to make it convert in dark alley
and you get minions mostly but sometimes other stuff
so better areas have a better chance for money earners etc
and only schools give you knowledge people
so generic minions are the basic
working minions earn you money
learning minions earn you knowledge
so I'm thinking that for each earning category we have like low wage etc
then we can have flavor text for getting them like you convert a prostitue
which gives you a low earning minion

does it really make sense for converting a human to cost more as you go?
probably not
so I want to start actually setting this up a bit
I think I want an info screen on the left
Then tabs for the other stuff with semi random results
lets plot out the first two tabs give or take and work on setting them up
with new buttons appearing as they are unlocked
I think for the first level of minion gathering we want to only give basic ones

I want each section to contain descriptions once they unlock
First section will be hunt
Feed generates blood
Convert Human: Dark Alley
Convert Human: Unlit Street
Quiet Park

Dark Alley only gives minions
implement the tabs using class ids and then toggle the showing
set this up with stats on left
hunt/feed giving minions
and then sacrifice killing 10 minions for better minion blood gen
then sac 25 minions for next level of consume

blood diamonds are what you use to get talent points
get them by buying them (buy what purports to buy a diamond but might be fake)
on a research mission
in combat as a drop

Investment banker for the convert option that gives money
when you restart you can only choose a class you have unlocked
you unlock classes by becoming a bit werewolf etc
defeat 10 werewolf lords and do a ritual with their blood
unlocks the werewolf stuff at the beginning
when you start as a werewolf though keeping a vampire talent makes you a bit of each
so lets say you are maybe 5% werewolf
yeah I think that's how I want it really serious downside
being a werewolf too lets you unlock cross upgrades
like lycanthrompire or something that let them feed into each other

so I want to tag each button with a div class
then I can enable whole sets of them wholesale
and only check for the ones I need
tag them with single use or multiple
current price, current upgrades etc
then I want to have counts of times explored for hunting etc
have threshholds unlock rare spawns so you can get better stuff lower sometimes
so like after 100 conversions in dark alley you can get money guys tehre rarely
eventually rarer spawns and better odds of rare spawns
have skills that unlock a say hourly button to give you a rare spawn
like next adventure is a rare

I want like rare, very rare, super rare, uber rare
with increasingly large gaps
and I want the rare buttons to upgrade as well
and I want them to be doubled at some point (next two encounters)
trim the time frame

skills that put some of your money towards your attack etc
so you get passive 10% of your blood gen as money gen
mostly I want the skills to all be game changers
and the raer spawns can be by category so the money one is part of hte money tree
so no worries about duplicates

lets do this raw HTML JS to start
then get some feedback and port it to flash
this conversion is going to come up a lot, time to get used to it
put a polished(ish) flash version on kongregate with just vampires
update it consistently
sell autoclickers for kreds
make monies

make items that are available for diamonds
sell diamonds
use diamonds for skills too
figure out a rate to sell them at
make diamonds really rare drops, maybe time limited (only 1 an hour)

add hunters and pvp eventually
flavor this as starting in a reality that has hunters
so you have to start again with pvp open
give really high rewards
allow previous incarnations to help though

so if upgrades cost minions we can hit some weird points
I think we just want some of the upgrades to cost minions

ok so feed, feed, feed
convert minion
minion cost goes up
unhealthy minion by the way
gets you .1 blood per second
at a certain amount of blood give a reduce suspicion skill
costs one minion and a chunk of blood
lets make it 50 blood (or less, twiceish the cost of minion 11)
reduces suspcion by like half
maybe a flat half so its always good but sometimes really good
not worth it at lower levels
find a good mid point here
then at 20 minions unlock the sacrifice button to give better area
the "power up"
so each area requires you sacrifice some of its minions to get hte next one
basic loop is then convert and get minions, sacrifice to throw off suspicion
what do I do to encourage people to stay in an area?
maybe have other skills that require certain minions too
like the less suspicion ones
or unhealthy minions produce more blood
so lets have the skill half suspicion
and go up in cost each time
how about 100 blood initially
and goes up by the same 1.5 scaling down with upgrades

ok what are all the variables I need initially
I need current blood, blood per second, minion counts (sickly, thin, healthy, fit,
 athletic), dark alley suspicion, suspicion factor, 

lets make a button object

id: convertDarkAlley
title: Convert: Dark Alley
location: darkalley
type: blood
screen: hunt
hidden: true
disabled? - probably can skip this
unhide: function () {
  if blood > 10 true
  else false
}
bloodCost: 10
minionCost: 0
moneyCost: 0
knowCost: 0
mightCost: 0
costMultiplier: 1.1
costCount: 0 // this is the one that can get reduced by reducing suspicion
timesClicked: 0
clickFunc: the function to attach to the button for clicking

I want base and current costs for each possible type as arrays
I think I'll do arrays and expand as I go
I might be able to skip curr costs but it also makes sense to use
put it there and print from there instead of generating it each time

so I want to add all these to the hidden array on init
then generate the screen based on them
so I need a generate screen loop or func after I make them all
I think I'll set up the divs themselves in the HTML
and just add the handlers
can I use an associative array here?
array[divid].disabled or whatever?

I mean I kind of want the button itself to have all these attributes
but thats not really a good way to do it
unless... can I attach the element itself to the object
so have an element field that is doc.getbyid('id') and actually change it there?
I think that might work
going to try this


loop through all visible
vis[i].getelementbyid(id).disabled if < cost
make that a function
pass it both parts

when do I want to change visibility?
loss of resource, gain of resource
if I keep bps to every second I can just have a check vis and check disable func
that fires once a second, and every time resources are spent or gained
in fact I could write a gain resource, lose resource function
call them in my button callbacks

so far so good
I think I can add an affects field too
so that suspicion can be reduced

I'm unhiding and disabling/enabling
now I need to make the rest of the convert button work as intended
and display its cost properly
then I'll create the suspicion button
**that is the test for if this method works**

sort out how I want to handle minion costs
I think I do want them to require certain minions
I don't really want to check every single type each time
maybe an array of costs and I check each part of the array?
yeah one array of cost types, one of those amounts
iterate over it
maybe make an array of minions and just keep the same order
that might be a lot easier
so its just like unhealthy etc
no then its still like array of 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 ...
hmm
yeah I think just checking each will be better
or maybe it could be minion5 and I could check the 5th element of the array
yeah I like that
consider a separate minion costs array too
non minion and minion, check each



I probably want feed as a button like this too
since I want work to be one eventually
and learn
and train

push all the currently hidden ones into an array
all the currently visible ones into another
only check to unhide the ones in the hidden array
only check disable status on the visible
use a function to check to unhide

ok so I refactored things to use an array of costs
this is overall a lot more efficient for now
I'll be constantly expanding a minion array but that's a bit off at least
now I need to hook the actual correct function into the button
and upgrade costs
and print text based on it

the text is right and upgrades properly
now I just need to add minions based on it
and dump text based on which minion

hmm ok so do I want to have it be hidden and not arrays for minions?  nah seems weird
I'll just unhide everything with all Time >0

ok so that is done, I have minions

now I need to set up a button for sacrificing a minion to reduce suspicion
implement that
and then a button for upgrading self to be stronger
and then that will lead into the next area

50 blood cost for this, or maybe 25?  25 blood and 1 minion would work ok
156 blood to get 10 minions, 181 for 11
60 blood for 5 minions
311 for 15 minions - 155 blood for minions 10 - 15 vs just under 90 for 5-10
making 25 blood quite reasonable to set that back a bit

ok yes for now, 25 blood and at least 1 unhealthy minion is the unlock for suspicion 1
10 minions is the unlock for next level

1/12/14 - set up the suspicion button
starts at 25 and 1 unhealthy and goes up by the 1.1

next up I want to separate out the cost text and print it programatically

separate cost - done

TODO: add virile blood upgrades, +bps, costs 25 blood, 1 minions - one shot - done
TODO: move suspicion up to probably 50 blood (should be fine) - done

TODO: add upgrade that unlocks next level set - done

sac 10 minions and how much blood, 250?
increased strength, bestial strength, brute strength, supernatural strength
then savagery for against the soldiers maybe?

ok I want the unlocks to be different
unhiding when they just can first buy it seems silly
I want the unlocks to be more specific than that, gives me more control
then I can force the next level upgrade to come first
or force it to come second or give it multiple ways
either way I can do it
I'll give it a function that returns true or false if it is ready to unlock
two arrays for locked ones
autounlocks and manual unlocks, better to trigger those from the button
I want the checks to be >= not just > in case of decimals

TODO: add in achievement for clicking, track it and add in upgrade - 100 blood 2x from clicks
- done
TODO: implement sub level 2 - including upgrade that unlocks it - done

needs some serious rebalancing of the unlocks but that can come later
rebalanced the blood per second to be less and it gives more minions

TODO: implement sub level 3 - jogging path - fit minions - done

100 blood convert - 500 blood 5 fit suspicion - poison organic food
vb3 - 250 b 10 m
str - 2500 b 50 m

TODO: implement sub level 4 - drug deal corner - hyped up minions

250 blood convert - 1500 blood 10 hyped minions suspicion - drug deal gone bad - done
vb4 - 1000 b 25 m
str - 10000 b 100 m

TODO: come up with interesting stats to track

blood spent makes upgrades cheaper?
minions sacrificed - chance for minions to live
total conversion clicks - makes conversion cheaper by reducing scaling factor
total conversions - makes cheaper by a flat amount
total suspicion clicks - makes suspicion cheaper by reducing scaling
total suspicion reductions - flat amount
sac'ed to suspicion, reduced amounts - so like you frame 2 and reduce suspicion by 10
max minions had of X counts, or just unlock when you hit the amount
total minions converted - gain 1% of minions extra rounded up - daily
gets replaced when you get the next one making conversion spree stronger but stays daily
blood generated passively - unlocks a part of bps to clicking
total minions - unlocks a plus to clicking based on curr minions

lets track total conversion clicks for now and implement this reduced scaling - done
also total minions for plus to clicking on current minions - done

ok yeah I outright need a calculate costs and display them function
that processes all the costs and constructs the html based on it
can I pass the string of a minion for a minion cost?

so the code for the calculate and display cost is working except that the clicks don't call it
plugged it into the clicks

TODO: implement achievements based on those stats - done
TODO: add in theming to some degree - tab and arrange a bit - done

wait lets hide and unhide the whole tab... maybe?
yeah this should work
just need to figure out how I am handling those on clicks
I could have them unlock just like regular blood buttons
then I could tag them as tabs in some way
might be worth having a type for other things anyways
just for like knowing which is which
and then I'll write a function to hide them all
and then each button will hide them all then unhide itself

ok so that works but what is the unlock for the upgrades tab?
we could track total upgrades, want to anyways
and trigger on that

that won't work, I can't get an upgrade until I click on one
and I'm making that tab invisible until I do

ended up also tagging them all with what they are
this is overall cleaner I think
that's good info to have anyways
and this way when I unlock an upgrade it goes into visible
the tabs check finds that at least one upgrade is visible and makes the tab visible

bloodXTab - Hunt, Ritual, Money, Research, Fight
func on 138

no going with hidden and visible blood tabs instead
with their own bloodTab object

TODO: make notifactions on the tabs when new stuff appears in them - done

lets add in a few variables to track if there is new content there
and I'll add in a loop that changes the text for tab to be the title + (X)
no put the notifications in each tab

something is not hitting right, its not seeing that notifications is defined
it might be a visibility order, race condition kind of thing
probably best to put some more safeguards into play here then just oh do this first
maybe make one call the other just to be sure
have a console log in right now starting the process of findign out whats throwing an error

The core of this works, still need to trigger notifications on the manual unlocks
so when a upgrade unlocks a new hunt zone I need to add a notification to it
probably make an add notify function and send it the id

TODO: add in text for clicks (just placeholder having it do it) - done
TODO: add in logging of that text - done

oops need the logging first before I increment costs if I reference them
fixed it, still need to correct numbers in converts

TODO: add in hovers for buttons or maybe just text for upgrades - done

let's do text for upgrades and have it in a div next to it
let's split the convert and cover ups like this too
for now lets just have a hover by using title="text I want"

TODO: add in chance to the converts

so I think 4 that even out to the number sounds good
so that starts at 25% each so we roll a d100 and assign
then we add the rares in
1% rare -> 1% very rare 2% rare -> 1% super rare 2 % very rare 3% rare
finally 1% uber rare 2% super rare 3% very rare 4% rare
100 uber 98-99 super 95-97 very 91-94 rare
for a total of 10%
so yeah I'm comfortable trimming 10% off of the "worst" drop
so it gets slightly better no matter what

so first we check if the uber rare is unlocked and if so assign based on it
then so on, not that bad
lets right a function to return the result
for the first area there is little swing
lets classify the 4 options though as bad, ok, good, great

so I wrote the function for this, just need to write out the content for rares
going to take a bit

TODO: add in rares - done

lets do them at 50, 200, 500, 1000
and we'll make an intelligent vampire in the skills that autoconverts for you later

TODO: rename the last strength skill and bump increased away - done

TODO: make the message log shrinkable - done

add a + which becomes a - for toggling if you see it

TODO: add unique message log - done

TODO: write actual normal text and make the messages have the right numbers

IMPT: these are my alley rares - done

passed out hobo converts for free, no blood no suspicion
drunk hobo gets you more minions at AA
end of world gives paranoid buff, costs more blood, less suspicion - in your favor though
starving homeless person gives feeding frenzy buff, lots more from manual feeds

for now lets add a badExtra() and so on for each of them
and it will use the average as baseline and make or kill a minion
maybe?  yeah it will reduce the current and all time or increase it
and I will add a FIXME for a buff if there would be one

crazy gives extra blood for time
living in box costs less because so sedentary
smelly gives you more minions from converts
crazy comes with and grabs blood while you convert
crazy hobo as end of world sign guy

red light

solo
girl and pimp
three way
solo watched by a couple convert them too

rares

kink club, bound people easy targets
to the brothel, huge convert
seductive, less blood to convert buff
infection ideas, +1 of each type you have

need to do joggers next - done

bad solo jogger 1
ok couple jogging together 2
good group of cheerleaders 6
great whole football team 11

rare track team, pick off one at a time for bonus
very rare heart rate boost, you gain passive bps
super rare you put some of your blood into the water for a marathon
uber rare you find bovine growth hormone in the blood, doubles all current blood

TODO: add colors to the rare text messages - done

// HERE

do drug deal corner, just push ahead with numbers and dummy text
move into finances screen



TODO: add in temporary buffs
TODO: write rare texts
TODO: copy all notes into one place and split them into files

TODO: once I get into multiple costs I'll probably want to write a pay cost function

convert pimp and ho
group of joggers taking a break
dealer and all customers

money people - mall

dumpster - minimum wage
parking garage - normal employee
restaurant - server, extra wages
cash drop - manager

money upgrades

lemonade stand
cookie store
candy shop
ice cream stand

give them upgrades that boost their own sales
so like lemon farm means you are growing your own lemons so it boosts their profit
then gives an upgrade to bank stuff for each

I want the upgrades for in the barracks to be intimidating strength, overpowering, omnipotent

I want to create a drop down select for which monster you currently are once that is an option
and it changes all of the visibility but you still get the other bonuses

at some point I want a fitness center that gives fit minions and money minions

and an upgrade to give professors tenure since they're immortal and give them free income

soup kitchen gets free hobos
STD clinic gets free hookers
fitness store gets free joggers
methadone clinic gets free drug dealers

could consider the upgrade for between zones to be flavored like running
you can run further so you can get to other areas before night

IMPT

consider making a one hour day night cycle.
starts at nightfall when they being playing
so part of hte challenge is to get through a good chunk before 30 mins is up
maybe
I think this fits werewolves well too
the first 30 mins is the most common play time anyways


then I want a virile blood upgrade, spend some blood to increase bps from minions
I'll have one of these for each of the 4 subzones
each of which will stack
I'll have them each double because why not

maybe we can make the first blood upgrade 25 and the suspicion 50
that will make it harder to be an issue

so I'll set up the suspicions management and stength unlocks for the whole first area
by whole first area I mean all the blood minions
once that is all set up I have sort of almost a game
then I'll give the last upgrade as you win for now alert

work out a better system for individual click handlers etc
there should be a ton of overlap in the what these functions are doing
can create one to update the display, one to charge the costs, one to recalc the costs etc
this should streamline the whole thing
the whole first zone worth should give me a solid idea of where that overlap lies

then I'll start working the text into those areas and make them more complicated
work the text in first then the rares

then the logging of the text
then the logging of the unique text

have an unlockable array that I can throw the buttons for the next area into
when the upgrade gets bought I'll toss them from that array into either hidden or vis

also attach a costid field and a cost div for each button, will look better for crazy
long costs

IMPT: consider time based reduction in suspicion and cost of allaying suspicion
consider making suspicion a visible stat for the zone
I think this is really interesting, it adds to the idle nature of the game a lot
you can come back and get a bunch of cheap vamps and burn through a lot of blood like that

also really consider having a upgrade that increases stuff based on achieves

consider not having the cover ups appear until I unlock them in general in some way
that would allow me a bit more control over the narrative there

for money mininons make the blood scaling a lot less harsh and the blood generation less great
basically start them all at 1 bps and just give more minions
and only scale to getting more

werwolves howl to build rage
lets rescale the converts so they all only grant one minion
and scale back some minion costs, not all the way but a chunk
maybe not honestly, lets play with it more first do some maths

frankenstein's monster (or golem of some sort)
will charge to build his energy, then expend some of that charge to animate limbs
will have to build new monsters from multiple limbs but individual limbs can do stuff
so you can have hands operating lab equipment and feet running on a treadmill to provide power
heads will research for you on their own
I'll come up with interesting amalgams that have their own roles and that will be what you build
so kind of similar to how werewolves operate with all the minion types but they'll be constructed
and you'll expend some arms and legs to make a thing
ooh or maybe you are the doctor himself, that would be cool too

cthulu

************IMPT*******************

so basically just a wait option (or sleep)
build madness
infect people with madness
then they record their madness as art to spread it
wait to produce money (Cthulu is patient and can wait forever for his investments to take hold)
dream to produce knowledge (when Cthulu dreams forbidden knowledge seeps into the mortal realm)
roar (when Cthulu roars madness turns to anger and anger to war or whatever I am calling the fight screen resource)
I can strip out most of the advanced stuff
just 4 infections that build madness
4 for money, 4 for knowledge, 4 for war
no suspicion reduction
occult ritual for the upgrades
sacrifice might make sense for some of them
I could make the scaling a little more friendly to start
I can make changes to make it better fit more overall structure eventually
win condition is awakening cthulu
consider upgrades of waking other elder gods
need to research options here
king in yellow gives bonuses to all war victories (maybe you get some troops back when the enemy dies)
Dagon could give bonuses to certain money people who work on shipping lanes
make a list of all the ones I want to include for sure
I could flavor most of the boosts as raising an elder god
then just general dark rituals for some of the other boosts
maybe elder gods as an unlock for the next?
That would make sense too
I'll look through the book and find some pairings
But first I can just lay out the structure with dummy names
get my spacing and everything laid out
gotta find a way to get a good pic for this
or skip the pic entirely for now and just go with a simplified button click like clicking bad
start with homeless people ranting
worship elder gods to unlock next level
then specific worship of a certain elder god to unlock a new level (worship dagon unlocks shipping crews for money ie)
then awaken the elder god for a significant bonus to that type, will require sacrifice of minions
definitely want it to pop up saying what I got
have an upgrade for cthulu that lets clicks earn you an amount of interest
I think there is a falling star that plays into cthulu lore, that could be my clickable golden cookie

went with madnessSpread as the equiv for bloodHunt
need to reformat my first madness minion button but it exists
I should really consider programatically generating these divs
make sure I am putting them into the right place with the sub tabs kind of stuff
maybe think about jquery pages
ok major restructure incoming
I need to change the unlockables to unlock the whole div
only make it hidden, unhide it and the rest will show
then I need to change my checks to check the div
buttons can all go into disabled maybe?  and never check them for showing
that should work

// ---------- HERE ----------

sort out how buttons are stored and handled
button is not unlocking because that loop is wrong now for triggered divs
more work to do here - done

CSS I need to fix the containing div and such but for now its working.  Just gotta choose some real values.
I also have a bug when I click on the madness tab.  Too many arrays of stuff gotta look at the right ones. - done

I want to have an unbought and bought div for the upgrades, place the bought ones under the "buildings"

put on github

figure out the money first bug
make tab bar 
consolidate once per second stuff into one loop before adding knowledge
add div generation for knowledge
same for knowledge
for knowledge I want a research capability bar
same for fight
for might I want a combined might bar
and fights will be decided by might vs might with losses
twice as many troops on your or their side will be a devastating loss or win with low casualties for winner
and complete for loser
three times will be overwhelming with nothing vs all
in between I'll sort out
even if you lose their force will go down
if you make kills the reanimator skill for might can raise them as zombies (or whatever)

set up falling star

when finished post it to reddit for feedback
while integrating feedback set up mobile versions
release to app store
release skills later work on them while sorting out app store

for next minion copy over all five then find replace MinionsOne with MinionsTwo
.1: .5: 2: 10: 50: 250: 1,000: 5,000: 20,000: 100,000: 500,000: 2,000,00: 10,000,000: 50,000,000: 200,000,000: 1,000,000,000

elder gods to include

Dagon - sea, also some money connections, probably sailors that make money
Yig / Quetzalcoatl - inventor of books, harvset significance, probably a good call for knowledge
Nyarlathotep - messenger so maybe good for knowledge, also revels in madness though
Shub-Niggurath - all mother
Azathoth - most powerful, might maybe? or maybe knowledge as the old rule, or money as corrupting greed of CEOs
Yog-Sothoth - is all knowing, definitely a knowledge one, final knowledge probably
Hastur - could be the king in yellow, going with no, make Hastur its own, brings parts of Earth into Carcosa
Cthugha - fire aligned, might be good for might
King in Yellow - with feverish dreams of a play that should never be read artistic people are more susceptible to madness.
Star spawn? - could be the last madness one overall and give abyssal warriors
Hounds of Tindalos - hungry beasts, probably good for might
Rhan-Tegoth - some mad wax artist worshipped him, might be a good non-eucledian artist thing
Magnum Innominandum - possibly the nameless mist
Ubbo-Sathla - maybe stole knowledge from its creators and brought it to our universe
Mother Hydra - superstitious sailors see unknowable things.  The tales of which chill others to their core.
mi-go and gugs and fungi?, blind albino penguins, zoog, dhole, star spawn -  could use these as warrior types
maybe each class having it own warriors and then converting others would be interesting
or that could be a cthulhu thing
with 4 warrior types they could each have their own bonuses
then might would mostly be converting human warriors to work alongside you
this would make a skill granting these warriors pretty valuable in other classes
could flavor the madness from more minions as chants like iya iya cthulhu ftagha
from my shirt - mi-go, star spawn, moon beast, gug, giant penguin

madness minions 1 - Crazy homeless person - The mad men with signs screaming about the end of the world won't do much to spread madness.
But it will do some.
min 2 unlock - awaken mother hydra - This dangerous ritual will awaken Mother Hydra and her brood of Deep Ones.
min 2 - Suspicious sailor - Seeing the deep ones at the sea has frayed their minds.  No one believes their tales of froglike fishmen but
it unsettles them nonetheless.
min 3 unlock  - open portal to Yuggoth - Pluto may not be a planet anymore but known by its ancient name of Yuggoth it is home to 
terrifying fungi that some text refer to as Mi-Go.  A sufficient sacrifice will draw their attention and open the portal again.
maybe flavor this as Mi-Go taking them on a trip and not everyone survives, loko up mi-go again for this.
min 3 - CDC investigator - Strange spores and fungi are mutating across the world and bringing incurable diseases with them.  The CDC
is learning vanishingly little but spreading great fear and hysteria.
min 4 unlock - awaken Shub-Niggurath - After sacrifice the Black Goat of the woods with a Thousand Young will awaken and her young
will begin to spread around the world.
min 4 - Conspiracy Theorist - Sightings of strange creatures lead conspiracy theorists to wild speculation.  No matter how horrifying
and alien their theories are they all fall short but they do show things are not as they seem.

money min 1 unlock - Contact the king in yellow - As madness increases the yellow sign becomes clearer and clearer.  A dangerous invocation
will reveal a gateway in the mind to Carcosa where the king in Yellow resides.
money min 1 - Avant Garde Artist - Visions of a play that should never be read dance through the minds of the mad and creative. Their
work becomes even more confusing but somehow more popular as well.
money min 2 unlock - Summon Hastur to Earth - Hastur alone possesses to power to transport people to and from Carcosa.  Much sacrifice
will be needed to convince him the trip is worthwhile.
money min 2 - Carcosan Architect - After an architect sees the buildings in Carcosa nothing they create will ever be the same.
money min 3 unlock - Enter the Dagon - The time has come to awake Father Dagon.  The seas roar with madness in anticipation.  The 
journey will be frought with genuinely unimaginable danger.
money min 3 - Pirate Captain - It takes a hardened soul to survive the new dangers in the sea.  Those who can keep their sanity (or
more likely only some of it) will find their pick of weak and profitable prey.
money min 4 unlock - Awaken Azathoth - From his throne at the center of the unseen universe beyond ours Azathoth once ruled the cosmos.  While
he slumbered times have changed and Cthulhu is ascendant.  His thirst for power is unquenchable, much blood will be required.
money min 4 - Greedy CEO - The thirst for power is well known to those at the top of the fortune food chain.  With Azathoth's influence
their means will feel justified and their ends will be horrifying to anyone not a stockholder.

know min 1 unlock - Awaken antartic city - A bizarre ancient ritual relating to Shoggoths and their home. Survive the cold and read 
the hieroglyphics and the mountains will echo with madness once again.
know min 1 - antartic researcher - Analyzing the massive blind penguins found in Antartica and the remnants of an ancient race of beings
destroys entire branches of theory.  The more they they research the more they know and the more they wish they didn't.
know min 2 unlock - Find Nyarlathotep - Nyarlathotep has been wandering the Earth for unknown aeons. Track him down and he will share
his vast knowledge with you.
know min 2 - fringe scientist - Fueled by the bizarre experiments of Nyarlathotep strange and terrifying experiments are begun and 
limits that should not be pushed are pushed.
know min 3 unlock - Revive Yig - Yig the serpent god under his guise as Quetzalcoatl died and was banished to the stars. An arcane
ritual will bring him forth once more and his knowledge of ancient cultures as well.
know min 3 - archaelogist adventurer - High spirited archaeologists are making connections they never had before. They are discovering
evidence of ancient races and it fetches a heavy price in museums.
know min 4 unlock - Summon Yog-Sothoth - Yog-Sothoth and his twin sons Nug and Yeb together keep the knowledge of past, present, and
future. Existing in all places and times summoning them to this one will be dangerous.
know min 4 - Historian Futurist - Through research into patterns of the past some futurists are better able to predict future events.
Little do they know where their newfound accuracy has come from.

knowledge is penguins, nyarlahotep, Yig / Quetzalcoatl, yog-sothoth

might is gug, moon beast, hound of tindalos, star spawn

knowledge buildings - library, community center, university (miskatonic online can go in here), grade school

I want the final structure to be to awaken cthulhu, to fund an expedition, to research the bloop location, and to lead his army
Its a four part victory condition each of which individually unlocks skills
when all 4 are done the earth is destroyed and you can find a new realm

maybe find some non-euclidean ones for money, some outside the box art and architecture summoned up
I think generically I want the last of each to be a big deal named one that people might know
or maybe the first of each category

for the madness from buildings make them tie to a minion type
require one a certain minion in addition to total minions
make the chants knowledge related, flavor the madness ones as a growing church/cult
maybe the money ones can be setting up websites, bookstores, churches etc
might I can get to

half way house
asylum
talk radio station
pharmaceutical company

have some buildings for money which add madness (probably at level of 1 - 4 mad mins)
could just roll straight into knowledge from there and make that the pattern

make sure unlock for money happens any time you have some money

This is the point where madness only cthulhu clicker is kind of complete

implement money unlock minions
implement money buildings
lemonade stand
cookie store
candy store
rock candy store - they only sell blue and operate out of basements but for some reason they are extremely popular.
implement interest
make tab bar 
same for knowledge
same for fight
set up falling star


probably need to tone down some of my unlocks
no suspicion reduction makes some of the minion losses pretty brutal
consider bringing them down to like 5 or so maybe even less
or have killing them bring the cost back down...
toned them down quite a bit and its a tad smoother, still balancing to do

really consider an unlock intro
dark room style leading up to a person is interacting with cthulhu
Ryan thinks events are a better idea than upgrades
stuff that happens could be a pop up of some sort maybe even with images

With Strange Aeons even Death may die - madness minions are immortal, final tier might upgrade


IMPT

have money interest be an upgrade
then I specifically spell out how it will work there
and it ramps the complexity up a bit slower

warriors train but they can only leve up in combat
surviving a combat makes you a tougher warrior
you can only train new levels of warriors after you get one from combat
combat will kill some amount but those that survive go up in level

********NEW GAME PLUS********

have the top menu bar have a switch class option
so you can work through the other class upgrades while waiting on your current class
then I can keep the menus all separated

********MOBILE*********

for mobile I want the top of my screen to be the buttons you press
then I can have maybe totals for each above or below them
then I'll have the bottom of the screen be a drop down where you can select an upgrade set
drop an exclamation point at the end of the current if others have unlocks
put the numbers into the drop down
then I'll dump all the upgrades into that bottom half of the screen
maybe start here and scale up
have a stats screen for different things
in fact start over as mobile
and reverse the cost order so more expensive newer stuff on top
consider tabs along the top instead and have some grayed out
actually teases better too
lets start a whole new file and just copy paste over the relavant chunks
I think I want to split screen so you can see what you are saving up for
so that way you can have your next upgrade info in front of you while clicking

look at having a clickable image (cthulu head) and have the buttons beneath
and you choose your current resource
I should actually mock this up
have like the menu underneath it for buyable stuff, tabs for now
and a tabbed set along the top for what you are making or maybe right underneath
they pop up at two tabs
and I can only show data for the current resource freeing up screen space
consider if I could make it switch both, not sure this is a good idea but consider it
ok lets try it like this, going to be a tab of madness, money, knowledge, might
when you switch the tabs you get the same (or slightly different) cthulu image to click
but the resource changes and the displayed stats changes
and the "buildings" you can buy and upgrades change
new upgrades that are unbought appear on top
bought upgrades appear on bottom
lets start with 16 madness "buildings" and 12 each for the other
lets get the buildings and tabs as visible and then look at spacing
see how much room I have to work with the weirdness of money and such
I'd like symbols for the tabs with small captions, brain for madness, $ for money, book for knowledge, fist for might

**** DEMONS ****

their resource is corruption
they convert souls
crossroads to get free souls
maybe even each conversion requires building the corruption up

***background color change notes****

ok so lets give even space to day and night
we have 60 increments to work with
i'm thinking 1/4 pure dark 1/4 pure light
lets do black fasing to purple and then into red
then red to orange into yellow into blue
lets' work on a fade from black to blue and back and then I can work others in later
ok going to use this thing from wikipedia
I also want a sunrise yellow and a sunset orange for one minute each
one minute each for these other three colors as well
so lets start at sunrise and then adjust it back to midnight
1 - sunrise
2 - 30 - day
31 - sunset
32 - civil twilight
33 - nautical twilight
34 - astro twilight
35 - 57 night
46 - midnight
58 - astro twilight
59 - nautical twilight
60 - civil twilight

46 is midnight

so if we make midnight 1

1 - midnight - black
2 - 12 night - black
13 - astro 
14 - nautical
15 - civil
16 - sunrise - Gold
17 - 45 - day - SkyBlue (87CEEB)
46 - sunset - OrangeRed
47 - civil - DeepSkyBlue
48 - nautical - DodgerBlue
49 - astro - MidnightBlue
50 - 60 - night

**** canvas for clicking madness text display notes ****

so I think I have a canvas overlayed now
get mouse position when the madness button is clicked
draw onto canvas the amount of plus madness as a draw text
I probably need to draw this in its own loop so it ends up on top
and find a way to center the text over it
maybe have an object so it contains the coords, the number and a display countdown

I might be looking at the wrong canvas in cookie clicker
keep looking at this and figure out how to do this
I might need to draw the image over the button maybe
or detect clicks on it as not a button
like maybe create a canvas for that top part and draw onto it in the order I want
detect where clicks happen and react to that instead of having it be a button
I could also make the whole thing a canvas maybe and just detect where clicks are happening with no buttons
I think top canvas is better though
see what orteil is doing here

so I should set the canvas and draw on the whole thing so I can see what its overlapping
then I can figure out how far I want it to go down
and only use the wrappers around the title, the current mad, the mad per second, and the button
make the button just on image
then set up click detection and check if its in the canvas
I can make the falling stars only appear there

make the button just an image
detect clicks on the image
create a click numbers object (amount, type, mousex, mousey, duration)
create a numbers array
create a function to display the numbers
loop through it decrementing and deleting them as needed

lets look at 77 pixels down image is 324 by 324

looking like 8, 127 to 332, 451

amount: moreMadness,
                type: "Madness",
		        xpos: mouseX,
		        ypos: mouseY,
		        timer: 10

ok gotta make a new 500x500 canvas and try to write on it see if it matches up


button id="madnessButton" onclick="madnessClick('madnessButton')"
right a function to display numbers 

alien class that tries to blend in, lots of different alien types slowly taking over


feedback for nanobot - caches are odd, wish they came back
nothing to do during first chunk of queen grow, let gen bots earlier
  probably would have been ok if I waited longer to evolve, that tip should appen before maybe
why don't upgrades activate when complete? I figured this out but it was unclear
  kind of buggy clicking on it
i like that it went back to resting when it fully grew
game advised me that queen getting too large is risky but also advised 200% as a good size
curve seemed good, so far
can we get commas on the research screen

rscharts - minecraft incremental

the situation seems to be that by rejecting the chicken as my business partner he now fights me
not super often but he has won every time so far since I had no army
losing money while trying to save up for something is annoying
more so for not knowing it was coming
I could have got the axe and gone to bed twice now if not for that
is he going to attack me a ton all night>?
I have 40k KPE from skilled and 200 from heavenly prior to sleep

conspiracy clicker
will should be with in opener

seems like way too much going on to start, we'll see if the interface clarifies
