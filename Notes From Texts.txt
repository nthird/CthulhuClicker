Skill tree for vampire. Unlock parallel dimension. Start as vampire or werewolf etc keeping a skill.

Rare spawns unlock after adventure there x times. Tag zones hunt learn etc. Check all tagged. 
Array of buttons as objects toggle visibility disabled etc. Skill to force rare spawns increase 
odds unlock sooner.

Warp fate activate to guarantee random spawn also have skills give new button on lock hours

Consider blood needed to stay OK. You only get extra blood when sated.

All homeless people, different text. Drink off wine in box etc.

Sleazy alley - incompetent pickpocket, strung out drug dealer, aged prostitute, insane beggar. Rare 
converts make them give money in one shot or become money minions.

Flavor this as an empowered conversion. Drunk hobo gets you more minions at AA

Living in box get some blood back because fat and sedentary. Crazy hobo gives a buff for extra 
blood generation. Smelly hobo gets you extra minions for next few conveys since less smell. Crazy 
comes with and grabs extra blood.

First crazy hobo as end of world sign guy.

Mall parking structure - 3 low wage 1 lower middle rares all up one. Fast food, movie theater, 
game store, restaurant. Rest is the better one. Cash on server, games on rate game store.

Buy ledgers to track populations of locations for passive rare unlocking. Buy homeless 
shelter for passive minions. Plasma donation for passive blood. Blood drive van cheaper option 
there. Soup kitchen cheaper minion.

Camp site and abandoned rest stop as other locations. Rest stop horny teens rare has drugs 
user needles for extra blood, drunk driver sleeping it off rare so drunk is easier to get
his thin blood. Partying teens, rare gives extra convert of their friends. Horror nuts, 
rare kills friends for blood buff.

Camp site, hippy rare you get high on acid see a purple hippo and drain it's blood.

Family camping trip triple convert, rare is extended family for like 7, romantic getaway two 
convert rare their blood is flowing fast extra blood buff. Boy scouts, lose blood but get 4, 
rare lose more blood get more convert.

10 first convert, 15, 20, 30 for next levels. Increase at 1.1 per time spent there? Sacrifice 
minions gets some from random parts of that? No. It just gets harder.  More likely to get caught.

It makes for an even more interesting trade off. Means we want first upgrade new area second 
better minions. Then new area again then less increase. Maybe the less increase can flavor as 
sneaky. Want it to be retroactive. Start at 1.5 move down to 1.1 over time.

Have a reduce suspicion skill in tree to make it easier once a day.

Like burn a building or crash a plane to explain away deaths reducing suspicion amount in
some areas. Less missing persons etc.

Oooh and get an airport eventually that makes money which unlocks a plane crash big suspicion
reduction option.

Softer feet for less suspicion per convert. Use achievements to track time spent in a area.

Make each class have different focus. Vampires get more rares by glamoring. Werewolves something
with moon cycles.

Werewolves get different minions and can make different Lycanthropes were Tiger etc. Eventually 
power self up similarly. What you can do depends on moon cycle. Can always create a minion only 
sometimes a werewolf. Skills involve getting more from the moon and activate moon phases. So you 
can create a waning and there is stuff you can only do then. Money minions are cats and dogs, 
knowledge are sea, attack are land and air.

Ghosts start in a hotel and unlock different parts of it rooms lobby ballroom little bit shining.
Way harder to get minions but costs a lot less to get upgrades. Eventually you take over the hotel.

Zombies make minions really easily but upgrades are really hard. Knowledge is slow to get and
accumulate.

Witches will also have a time component but less solid than Werewolves. Bonus but not limiting.
Has a familiar you can choose one active. Skills give New familiars and eventually more slots.
Familiars have skills like bonus convert or money.

Ghosts eventually get a on timer free minion where they raise a ghost, scar rooms for passive
ghost generation.

Idle like a monster

Have researchers dissect minions to learn more. Have fighters use minions as training dummies.

Have a gain a money minion skill. Gain one now and each hour. Let's on ascension people start
how they like.

Each path has a win. Each win opens ascend. Gives diamonds. More for each.

Buy company with portal. Find location of portal. Take over base where humans had portal.

Maybe like more alley locations. Move from dark to dim or well lit or dirty or trash filled.
i think vampires should stay city mostly.

One could be a red light district.

Hearing for alley upgrades.

No, brute strength. Strong enough to take out bigger

Jogging path fit minion. Drug deal corner for strung out.

Crack head minions are strong get you more blood. After alley a mall for job minions. Get better 
listening or hiding skills here. Then school. Seduction skills.

Give each zone one final upgrade for getting each rare.

Make it a big bonus to their types of minions.

Money. Do a four set that just benefits itself. So more money . Then start on getting more blood,
then passive minions. Consider a drive out competitor's option. Maybe not reusable or at the cost
of buildings. Or every so often you can burn one down for insurance money.

Money will include a work button clicked for money. What sets money apart? You could invest a 
chunk to earn interest. So have a set of upgrades to increase amount you can invest. 
Interest rate, etc.

Yeah interest is the thing I will use to set money apart. Interest will be off money on bank so 
that for idle buying less business is better. Let's start worth a lemonade Stand, cookie bakery, 
candy shop, I've cream truck. Nice nods to other games.

Knowledge mostly self feeding. Write books to help other scientists. Want more here. Battle you 
train on your own or better in combat but is risky.

What if knowledge only goes up and you just have to have certain amounts. Maybe more items not 
repeatable. Basically all upgrades.

Have a skill for intelligent vampires that convert for you in an area you know 100 explored know.

Fleet footed gives mall increased stamina gives school. Sneak around mall. Charm school.

For Frankenstein you assemble the pieces without knowing if it will work.

And you unlock more slots as you go. So just two to start

I could do an extra effect function for each of the cases. Let's do that for now.
